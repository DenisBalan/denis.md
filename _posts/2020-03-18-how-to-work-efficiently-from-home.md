Working from home has many advantages: you do not waste time on the way to the office, you make up your own schedule of the working day, you may have more time for yourself.

On the other hand, it can be difficult to achieve the same level of productivity as in the office. You can easily give in to laziness, distracted by trifles, stretch small tasks for the whole day. To make sure this doesn't happen, i am sharing my experience and tips to help you stay focused and work effectively.

## Set up your own home office

I set up aside a corner in the apartment for workplace. There is no TV, no household items, no children's toys.

You should distinguish between the place where you sleep and rest and the area where you work. Other life-hack that you can try is to buy a screen and fence off your desk during the working day.

## Keep to the schedule

Who works from home is his own boss, so it is very easy to succumb to the temptation and finish work a couple of hours early, or a couple of hours later, or stretch your lunch.

Make sure you have a clear time schedule and try to keep it. Smartphone reminders can help you do this by letting you know it's time to finish your snack or finish today's work.

## Rest for the eyes

Working from home often means that you have far fewer face-to-face meetings that could help eyes rest from the computer screen. Trying to do quality work with tired eyes or exhausted minds will not lead to the desired result.

Time will be wasted. But if there are only a few small tasks, then it is better to take a short break and productively complete all of them.

## Take breaks

One of the downsides of the home office - with all the possible distractions, there is no possibility at home to be distracted for a few minutes and take a break.

When in the office, i can do this while going the water cooler, or chatting over a cup of coffee. Try to take short breaks though - go out for a breath on the balcony, take your dog (if you have one) for a walk and run for half an hour.

## Socialize

Although modern technology offers many opportunities for communication, do not forget about live communication. Arrange personal meetings with colleagues, friends or work partners at least several times a week (not while in quarantine of _COVID-19_ of course).
